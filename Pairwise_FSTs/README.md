## FST matrix as a distance matrix for the .diffs input file

This section is in response to the following question from Ã€lex Mas, PhD student at David Coma's lab, in the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, in Barcelona:

**I wonder which conditions the matrix must accomplish and how a FST matrix could work as the .diffs file.**

(Thank you for the interesting question.)

It is not appropriate to plug in the matrix of pairwise $F_{ST}$s for the matrix of average genetic differences `diffs`. Instead, I have written a modified version `runeems_Fsts`.

* `FSTs-as-diffs.pdf` are my notes on `runeems_Fsts`. These serve as documentation, so read them first. The notes also explain why it was necessary to modify the original implementation.
* `runeems_Fsts/data` contains two datasets I have used for testing.
* `runeems_Fsts/src` contains the modified EEMS program to use with the $F_{ST}$ matrix.
* `runeems_Fsts/src0` contains an earlier version of the modified EEMS program, included here for completeness.
