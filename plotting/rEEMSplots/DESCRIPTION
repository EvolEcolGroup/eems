Title: Generate EEMS graphics output
Authors@R: person("Desislava", "Petkova", email = "desislavka@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides several functions to visualize the results of EEMS.
    \code{eems.plots} produces contour plots of the effective migration and diversity rates,
    as well as scatterplots of observed vs fitted genetic dissimilarities.
    \code{eems.population.grid} plots the population grid, with all edges in the same color,
    to visualize the grid before estimating migration and diversity rates.
    \code{eems.voronoi.samples} and \code{eems.posterior.draws} both take random samples
    from the posterior distribution of the migration and diversity rates and plot
    them to visualize the posterior variance (in a slightly different way).
    \code{eems.resid.heatmap} computes the matrix of residuals (differences between the
    observed and fitted dissimilarities) and plots it as a heat map.
